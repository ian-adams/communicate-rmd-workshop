## Overview

In this full-day workshop, you'll learn how to get more out of R Markdown (and friends). We will demystify how R Markdown works under the hood. You will learn practical tools and workflows to increase your efficiency and productivity using R Markdown (including RStudio IDE features and templates), while learning how to use some extension packages along the way. We assume that you have knit an R Markdown document before, but you donâ€™t need to be an advanced R Markdown user to take this workshop.
